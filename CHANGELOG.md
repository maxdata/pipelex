# Changelog

## [v0.14.0] - 2025-10-27

### Added
 - **`pipelex doctor` command**: Diagnoses and fixes common configuration issues including missing files, invalid telemetry settings, and unset environment variables for enabled backends.
 - **Interactive backend selection in `pipelex init`**: Multi-select menu for enabling/disabling inference backends (OpenAI, Anthropic, Amazon Bedrock, etc.).
 - **JSON input support**: `pipelex run --inputs` flag accepts a JSON file path for passing structured data to pipelines.
 - **`pretty_print` methods**: Added to `PipeSpec`, `ConceptSpec`, and `Stuff` objects for readable debugging output.
 - **VS Code debug configuration**: "Debug run pipe" launch configuration for debugging pipeline executions.
 - **`display_name` attribute**: Added to all inference backends in `backends.toml` for better UI presentation.
 - **Documentation headers**: All default `.toml` configuration files now include headers with links to documentation and support channels.

### Changed
 - **`pipelex init` redesign**: Transformed into a unified, interactive setup wizard with rich terminal UI for configuration files, backend selection, and telemetry preferences. Telemetry is now configured here instead of via first-run prompt.
 - **`README.md` rewrite**: Complete overhaul featuring a simplified 5-step quick-start guide highlighting the `pipelex build` command.
 - **Documentation updates**: "Quick Start" guide renamed to "Writing Workflows" with simplified content. Python examples updated to use JSON input method, removing manual `Stuff` and `WorkingMemory` object creation boilerplate. Developer guides and AI assistant rules now recommend `pipelex validate` over `make validate`. Added instructions emphasizing `.venv` activation before running commands.
 - **Error handling improvements**: Pipelines now validate required inputs upfront and fail early with `PipeRunInputsError`. `pipelex run` prints full rich-formatted exception tracebacks on error.
 - **Default enabled backends**: Amazon Bedrock, Google AI, and Google Vertex AI are now enabled by default.
 - **Naming consistency**: "AWS Bedrock" renamed to "Amazon Bedrock" throughout codebase, configuration, and documentation.

### Fixed

- Some documentation links were broken.

## [v0.13.2] - 2025-10-25

### Added

- Added the `n8n` documentation page for the [n8n-nodes-pipelex](https://github.com/Pipelex/n8n-nodes-pipelex) package.
- Added optional telemetry system with first-run interactive prompt offering three modes: off (no data collected), anonymous (usage data without identification), and identified (usage data with user identification). Automatically respects `DO_NOT_TRACK` environment variable and redacts sensitive data (prompts, responses, file paths, URLs). Configuration stored in `.pipelex/telemetry.toml`.
- Added telemetry documentation: user-friendly setup guide and comprehensive configuration reference.

### Changed

- Updated the `PipelexClient` and changed the route of the API calls to `v1/pipeline/execute` and `v1/pipeline/start`.
- Changed the parameter `input_memory` to `inputs` in the documentaton.

## [v0.13.1] - 2025-10-22

### Changed

- Changed the `pydantic`dependency from `==2.10.6` to `>=2.10.6,<3.0.0` to avoid compatibility issues.

## [v0.13.0] - 2025-10-21

### Highlights - Simplifying pipeline execution and improving developer experience

This release focuses on making Pipelex more accessible and easier to use, with major improvements to the CLI, simplified syntax for multiplicity, and a complete documentation overhaul:

- **New CLI commands**: Run pipelines directly with `pipelex run`, generate Python runners with `pipelex build runner`, and inspect your AI backend configuration with `pipelex show backends`
- **Simplified pipeline inputs**: The new `inputs` parameter replaces `input_memory` and accepts strings, lists, or content objects directly - no more complex dictionary structures
- **Getting started faster**: Completely rewritten quick-start guide and new documentation sections help you go from installation to your first pipeline in minutes

### Added

- CLI command `pipelex run`: Top-level command to execute pipelines directly from the CLI. Can run pipes from the package or from any `.plx` bundle file, with options to provide inputs from a JSON file and save the output
- CLI command `pipelex build runner`: Generates Python script with imports and example input structures for any pipe
- CLI command `pipelex show backends`: Displays configured AI providers, their status, and active routing rules
- Model presets: Added task-oriented presets including `llm_to_write_questions`, `llm_to_code`, `llm_for_basic_vision`, `llm_for_visual_analysis`
- Documentation: Complete quick-start guide rewrite, new guides for "Understanding Multiplicity", "API Guide", "Executing Pipelines with Inputs", and updated README with video demo
- Migration guide: Updated guide at `pipelex/kit/migrations/migrate_0.11.0_0.12.x.md`

### Changed

- **Unified bracket notation for multiplicity**: Single items use `"Concept"`, variable lists use `"Concept[]"`, fixed-count lists use `"Concept[3]"`. Applies to both `inputs` and `output` fields in `.plx` files
- **Pipeline input format**: `input_memory` parameter renamed to `inputs`; now accepts strings, lists of strings, `StuffContent` objects, or explicit concept dictionaries instead of `CompactMemory`
- **Bundle `main_pipe` attribute**: Pipelex bundles (`.plx` files) now support a `main_pipe` attribute to designate the primary entry point of the bundle. Used by `pipelex run` and `pipelex build runner` commands to simplify execution
- **Model preset names**: `llm_to_reason` → `llm_for_complex_reasoning`, `base_ocr_mistral` → `extract_text_from_visuals`, `base_extract_pypdfium2` → `extract_text_from_pdf`, `base_img_gen` → `gen_image_basic`, `fast_img_gen` → `gen_image_fast`, `high_quality_img_gen` → `gen_image_high_quality`
- **Unified model parameter**: `PipeExtract` and `PipeImgGen` now use `model` parameter for consistency across all operator pipes
- **`PipeExtract` operator**: Output is now consistently validated to be the `Page` concept, simplifying its usage for document processing
- **CLI improvements**: `pipelex run` and `pipelex validate` now auto-detect pipe code vs `.plx` bundle files; `pipelex validate` promoted to top-level command with improved error reporting and syntax-highlighted code snippets
- **CLI reorganization**: Main command-line interface restructured for better usability with improved help texts and more logical command order
- **Python API**: `Pipelex.make()` now accepts dependency injection arguments directly
- **Python coding standards**: Updated internal coding standards to recommend declaring variables with a type but no default value to better leverage linters for bug detection
- **Default configuration**: Azure and AWS inference backends now disabled by default in template configuration

### Fixed

- Structure generation: Special characters (double quotes, backslashes) in concept field descriptions or default values no longer produce invalid Python code

### Removed

- Legacy multiplicity syntax: `nb_output`, `multiple_output` parameters, and complex input dictionary syntax with `multiplicity` field
- Pipe-specific model parameters: `ocr` parameter from `PipeExtract` and `img_gen` parameter from `PipeImgGen`
- `prompt_template_to_structure` and `system_prompt_to_structure` configurations at the pipe and domain level
- Project Name discovery from Configuration
- Temporary design document for the new inference backend system (feature now fully implemented and documented)

## [v0.12.0] - 2025-10-15

### Highlights - Moving fast and breaking things

- Added the new builder pipeline system for auto-generating Pipelex bundles from user briefs
  - it's a pipeline to generate pipelines, and it works!
  - the pipeline definitions are in `pipelex_libraries/pipelines/base_library/builder/`
  - removed the previous draft which was named `meta_pipeline.plx`

**Breaking changes... for good!**

We tried to group all the renamings we wanted to do which impact our language, so that you get one migration to apply and then we will be way more stable in the future releases.

This is all in the spirit of making Pipelex a declarative language, where you express what you want to do, and the system will figure out how to do it. So our focus inwas to make the Pipelex language easier to understand and use for non-technical users, and at the same time use more consistent and obvious words that developers are used to.

**💡 Pro tip:** To make migration easier, pass the [migration guide](https://github.com/Pipelex/pipelex/blob/main/pipelex/kit/migrations/migrate_0.11.0_0.12.0.md) to your favorite SWE agent (Cursor, Claude Code, github copilot, etc.) and let it handle the bulk of the changes!

- **Removed centralized `pipelex_libraries` folder system**
  - Pipelines are now auto-discovered from anywhere in your project—no special directory required
  - No config path parameters needed in `Pipelex.make()` or CLI commands (just call `Pipelex.make()`)
  - Custom functions require `@pipe_func()` decorator for auto-discovery
  - Structure classes auto-discovered (must inherit from `StructuredContent`)
  - Configuration stays at repository root in `.pipelex/` directory
  - See [migration guide](https://github.com/PipelexLab/pipelex/blob/main/pipelex/kit/migrations/migrate_0.11.0_0.12.0.md) for details on reorganizing your project structure

- General changes
  - renamed `definition` fields to `description` across all cases

- Renamed **PipeJinja2** to **PipeCompose**
  - the fact that our templating engine is Jinja2 is a technnical detail, not fundamental to the language, especially since we included a pre-processor enabling insertion of variables in prompts using `@variable` or `$variable`, in addition to the jinja2 syntax `{{ variable }}`
  - renamed `jinja2` field to `template` for the same reason
  - for more control, instead of providing a string for the `template` field, you can also use a nested `template` section with `template`, `category` and `templating_style` fields

- Renamed **PipeOCR** to **PipeExtract**
  - this is to account for various text extraction techniques from images and docs, including but not only OCR; e.g. we now have integrated the `pypdfium2` package which can extract text and images from PDF, when it's actually real text (not an image), and soon we'll add support for other document extraction models solutions
  - removed obligation to name your document input `ocr_input`, it can now be named whatever you want as long as it's a single input and it's either an `Image` or a `PDF` or some concept refining PDF or Image
  - renamed `ocr_page_contents_from_pdf` to `extract_page_contents_from_pdf`
  - renamed `ocr_page_contents_and_views_from_pdf` to `extract_page_contents_and_views_from_pdf`
  - introduced model settings and presets for extract models like we had for LLMs
  - renamed `ocr_model` to `model` for choice of model, preset, or explicit setting and introduced `base_ocr_mistral` as an alias to `mistral-ocr`

- **PipeLLM** field renames
  - image inputs must now be tagged in the prompt like all other inputs; you can just drop their names at the beginning or end of the prompt, or you can reference them in meaningful sentences to guide the Visual LLM, e.g. "Analyze the colors in $some_photo and the shapes in $some_painting." 
  - renamed `prompt_template` field to `prompt`
  - renamed `llm` field to `model`
  - renamed `llm_to_structure` field to `model_to_structure`

- **PipeImgGen** field renames
  - renamed `img_gen` field to `model` for choice of model, preset, or explicit setting
  - removed some technical settings such as `nb_steps` from the pipe attributes, instead you can set these as model settings or model presets
  - introduced model settings and presets for image generation models like we had for LLMs

- **PipeCondition** field renames
  - renamed `pipe_map` to `outcomes`
  - renamed `default_pipe_code` to `default_outcome` and it's now a required field, because we need to know what to do if the expression doesn't match any key in the outcomes map; if you don't know what to do in that case, then it's a failure and you can use the `fail` value

- **Configuration file changes** (`.pipelex/` directory)
  - Renamed parameter `llm_handle` to `model` across all LLM presets in deck files
  - Renamed parameter `img_gen_handle` to `model` across all image generation presets in deck files
  - Renamed parameter `ocr_handle` to `model` in extraction presets
  - Renamed `ocr` section to `extract` throughout configuration files
  - Renamed `ocr_config` to `extract_config` in `pipelex.toml`
  - Renamed `base_ocr_pypdfium2` to `base_extract_pypdfium2`
  - Renamed `is_auto_setup_preset_ocr` to `is_auto_setup_preset_extract`
  - Renamed `nb_ocr_pages` to `nb_extract_pages`
  - Updated pytest marker from 'ocr' to 'extract'

## [v0.11.0] - 2025-10-01

### Highlights

- **New pipe builder** pipeline to generate Pipes based on a brief in natural language: use the cli `pipelex build pipe "Your task"` to build the pipe.
- **New observer system:** inject your own class to observe and trace all details before and after each pipe run. We also provide a local observer that dumps the payloads to local JSONL files = new-line delilmited json, i.e. one json object per line.
- **Full refactoring of OCR and Image Generation** to use the same patterns as `LLM` workers and pipes.

### Added

 - Added `claude-4.5-sonnet` to the model deck.

- Enabled all backends, still required to pass all unit tests.
- A few tweaks to the base model deck.

## [v0.10.0] - 2025-09-17

### Highlight: New Inference Backend Configuration System

We've completely redesigned how LLMs are configured and accessed in Pipelex, making it more flexible and easier to get started:

- **Get started in seconds** with [Pipelex Inference](pages/configuration/config-technical/inference-backend-config.md): Use a single API key to access all major LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Mistral, and more)
- **Flexible backend configuration**: Configure multiple inference backends (Azure OpenAI, Amazon Bedrock, Vertex AI, etc.) through simple TOML files in `.pipelex/inference/`
- **Smart model routing**: Automatically route models to the right backend using [routing profiles](pages/configuration/config-technical/inference-backend-config.md#routing-profiles) with pattern matching
- **User-friendly aliases**: Define shortcuts like `best-claude` → `claude-4.1-opus` with optional fallback chains
- **Cost-aware model specs**: Each model includes detailed pricing, capabilities, and constraints for better cost management

For complete details, see the [Inference Backend Configuration](pages/configuration/config-technical/inference-backend-config.md) documentation.

### Added

- New inference backend configuration system in `.pipelex/inference/` directory

- **WorkingMemoryFactory Enhancement**: New `make_for_dry_run()` method creates working memory with realistic mock objects for zero-cost pipeline testing
- **Enhanced Dry Run System**: Complete dry run support for all pipe controllers (`PipeCondition`, `PipeParallel`, `PipeBatch`) with mock data generation using `polyfactory`
- **Comprehensive Static Validation**: Enhanced static validation with configurable error handling for missing/extraneous input variables and domain validation
- **TOML File Validation**: Automatic detection and prevention of trailing whitespaces, formatting issues, and compilation blockers in pipeline files
- **Pipeline Testing Framework**: New `dry_run_all_pipes()` method enables comprehensive testing of entire pipeline libraries
- **Enhanced Library Loading**: Improved error handling and validation during TOML file loading with proper exception propagation

### Configuration

- **Dry Run Configuration**: New `allowed_to_fail_pipes` setting allows specific pipes (like infinite loop examples that fail on purpose) to be excluded from dry run validation
- **Static Validation Control**: Configurable error reactions (`raise`, `log`, `ignore`) for different validation error types

### Documentation & Development Experience

- **Cursor Rules Enhancement**: Comprehensive pipe controller documentation covering `PipeSequence`, `PipeCondition`, `PipeBatch`, and `PipeParallel`, improved PipeOperator documentation for `PipeLLM`, `PipeOCR`
- **Pipeline Validation CLI**: Enhanced `pipelex validate all -c pipelex/libraries` command with better error reporting and validation coverage

## [v0.4.11] - 2025-06-30

- **LLM Settings Simplification**: Streamlined LLM choice system by removing complex `for_object_direct`, `for_object_list`, and `for_object_list_direct` options. LLM selection now uses a simpler fallback pattern: specific choice → text choice → overrides → defaults.
- **Image Model Updates**: Renamed `image_bytes` field to `base_64` in `PromptImageTypedBytes` for better consistency. Updated to use `CustomBaseModel` base class to benefit from bytes truncation when printing.

## [v0.4.10] - 2025-06-30

- Fixed a bad import statement

## [v0.4.9] - 2025-06-30

### Highlights

**Plugin System Refactoring** - Complete overhaul of the plugin architecture to support external LLM providers.

### Added

- **External Plugin Support**: New `LLMWorkerAbstract` base class for integrating custom LLM providers, and we don't mean only an OpenAI-SDK-based LLM with a custom endpoint, now the implementation can be anything, as long as it implements the `LLMWorkerAbstract` interface.
- **Plugin SDK Registry**: Better management of SDK instances with proper teardown handling
- **Enhanced Error Formatting**: Improved Pydantic validation error messages for enums

### Changed

- **Plugin Architecture**: Moved plugin system to dedicated `pipelex.plugins` package
- **LLM Workers**: Split into `LLMWorkerInternalAbstract` (for built-in providers) and `LLMWorkerAbstract` (for external plugins)
- **Configuration**: Plugin configs moved from main `pipelex.toml` to separate `pipelex_libraries/plugins/plugin_config.toml` (⚠️ breaking change)
- **Error Handling**: Standardized credential errors with new `CredentialsError` base class

## [v0.4.8] - 2025-06-26

  - Created `tests/helpers/` package for test utilities
  - Cleaned up test imports and removed empty `__init__.py` files
- **Class registry refactoring**: Updated kajson from 0.1.6 to 0.2.0, adapted to changes in [Kajson](https://github.com/Pipelex/kajson)'s class registry with new `ClassRegistryUtils` (better separation of concerns)
- **Dependency updates**:
  - Added pytest-mock to dev dependencies for improved unit testing

### Added
- **Coverage commands**: New Makefile targets for test coverage analysis:
  - `make cov`: Run tests with coverage report
  - `make cov-missing` (or `make cm`): Show coverage with missing lines
- **Test configuration**: Set `xfail_strict = true` in pytest config for stricter test failure handling
- **Pydantic validation errors**: Enhanced error formatting to properly handle model_type errors

### Fixed
- **External links**: Removed broken Markdown target="_blank" syntax from MANIFESTO.md links

## [v0.4.3] - 2025-06-19

### Fixed
- **Removed deprecated Gemini 1.5 models**: Removed `gemini-1.5-flash` and `gemini-1.5-pro` from the VertexAI integration as they are no longer supported
- Fixed multiple import statements across the codebase

### Documentation
- **Enhanced MkDocs search**: Added search functionality to the documentation site
- **Proofreading improvements**: Fixed various typos and improved clarity across documentation

### Refactor
- Mini refactor: changed kajson dependency to `kajson==0.1.5` (instead of `>=`) to tolerate temporary breaking changes from kajson

## [v0.4.2] - 2025-06-17

- Fixed the inheritance config manager method (Undocumented feature, soon to be removed)
- Fixed the `deploy-doc.yml` GitHub Action
- Grouped the mkdocs dependencies in a single group `docs` in the `pyproject.toml` file

## [v0.4.1] - 2025-06-16

- Changed discord link to the new one: https://go.pipelex.com/discord
- Added `hello-world` example in the `cookbook-examples` of the documentation.

## [v0.4.0] - 2025-06-16

### Highlight: Complete documentation overhaul

- **MkDocs** setup for static web docs generation
    - **Material** for MkDocs theme, custom styling and navigation
    - Other plugins: meta-manager, glightbox
    - **GitHub Pages** deployment, mapped to [docs.pipelex.com](http://docs.pipelex.com)
    - Added GHA workflows for documentation deployment and validation
- **Added to docs:**
    - [**Manifesto**](https://docs.pipelex.com/manifesto/) explaining the Pipelex viewpoint
    - [**The Pipelex Paradigm**](https://docs.pipelex.com/pages/pipelex-paradigm-for-repeatable-ai-workflows/) explaining the fundamentals of Pipelex's solution
    - [**Cookbook examples](https://docs.pipelex.com/pages/cookbook-examples/)** presented and explained, commented code, some event with [mermaid](https://docs.pipelex.com/pages/cookbook-examples/invoice-extractor/) [flow](https://docs.pipelex.com/pages/cookbook-examples/extract-gantt/) [charts](https://docs.pipelex.com/pages/cookbook-examples/write-tweet/)
    - And plenty of details about **using Pipelex** and **developing for Pipelex,** from **structured generation** to PipeOperators (**LLM**, **Image generation**, **OCR**…) to PipeControllers (**Sequence**, **Parallel**, **Batch**, **Condition**…), workflow **optimization**, workflow static **validation** and dry run… there's still work to do, but we move fast!
- **Also a major update of Cursor rules**

### Tooling Improvements

- Pipeline tracking: restored **visual flowchart generation using Mermaid**
- Enhanced dry run configuration: added more granular control with `nb_list_items`, `nb_extract_pages`, and `image_urls`
- New feature flags: better control over pipeline tracking, activity tracking, and reporting
- Improved OCR configuration: handle image file type for Mistral-OCR, added `default_page_views_dpi` setting
- Enhanced LLM configuration: **better prompting for structured generation with automatic schema insertion** for two-step structuring: generate plain text and then structure via Json
- Better logging: Enhanced log truncation and display for large objects like image bytes (there are still cases to deal with)

### Refactor

**Concept system refactoring**

- Improved concept code factory with better domain handling, so you no longer need the `native` domain prefix for native domains, you can just call them by their names: `Text`, `Image`, `PDF`, `Page`, `Number`…
- Concept `refines` attribute can now be a string for single refined concepts (the most common case)

### Breaking Changes

- File structure changes: documentation moved from `doc/` to `docs/`
- Configuration changes: some configuration keys have been renamed or restructured
- `StuffFactory.make_stuff()` argument `concept_code` renamed to `concept_str` to explicitly support concepts without fully qualified domains (e.g., `Text` or `PDF` implicitly `native` )
- Some method signatures have been updated

### Tests

- **Added Concept refinement validation:** `TestConceptRefinesValidationFunction` and `TestConceptPydanticFieldValidation` ensure proper concept inheritance and field validation

## [v0.3.2] - 2025-06-13

- Improved automatic insertion of class structure from BaseModel into prompts, based on the PipeLLM's `output_concept`. New unit test included.
- The ReportingManager now reports costs for all pipeline IDs when no `pipeline_run_id` is specified.
- The `make_from_str` method from the `StuffFactory` class now uses `Text` context by default.

## [v0.3.1] - 2025-06-10

### Added
- New pytest marker `dry_runnable` for tests that can run without inference.
- Enhanced `make` targets with dry-run capabilities for improved test coverage:
  - `make test-xdist` (or `make t`): Runs all non-inference tests **plus inference tests** that support dry-runs - fast and resource-efficient
  - `make test-inference` (or `make ti`): Runs tests requiring actual inference, with actual inference (slow and costly)
- Parallel test execution using `pytest-xdist` (`-n auto`) enabled for:
  - GitHub Actions workflows
  - Codex test targets
  
### Changed
- Domain validation is now less restrictive in pipeline TOML: the `description` attribute is now `Optional`

## [v0.3.0] - 2025-06-09

### Highlights

- **Structured Input Specifications**: Pipe inputs are now defined as a dictionary mapping a required variable name to a concept code (`required_variable` -> `concept_code`). This replaces the previous single `input` field and allows for multiple, named inputs, making pipes more powerful and explicit. This is a **breaking change**.
- **Static Validation for Inference Pipes**: You can now catch configuration and input mistakes in your pipelines *before* running any operations. This static validation checks `PipeLLM`, `PipeExtract`, and `PipeImgGen`. Static validation for controller pipes (PipeSequence, PipeParallel…) will come in a future release.
    - Configure the behavior for different error types using the `static_validation_config` section in your settings. For each error type, choose to `raise`, `log`, or `ignore`.
- **Dry Run Mode for Zero-Cost Pipeline Validation**: A powerful dry-run mode allows you to test entire pipelines without making any actual inference calls. It's fast, costs nothing, works offline, and is perfect for linting and validating pipeline logic.
    - The new `dry_run_config` lets you control settings, like disabling Jinja2 rendering during a dry run.
    - This feature leverages `polyfactory` to generate mock Pydantic models for simulated outputs.
    - Error handling for bad inputs during `run_pipe` has been improved and is fully effective in dry-run mode.
    - One limitation: currently, dry running doesn't work when the pipeline uses a PipeCondition. This will be fixed in a future release.

### Added

- **`native.Anything` Concept**: A new flexible native concept that is compatible with any other concept, simplifying pipe definitions where input types can vary.
- Added dependency on `polyfactory` for mock Pydantic model generation in dry-run mode.

### Changed

- **Refactored Cognitive Workers**: The abstraction for `LLM`, `ImgGen`, and `Ocr` workers has been elegantly simplified. The old decorator-based approach (`..._job_func`) has been replaced with a more robust pattern: a public base method now handles pre- and post-execution logic while calling a private abstract method that each worker implements.
- The `b64_image_bytes` field in `PromptImageBytes` was renamed to `base_64` for better consistency.

### Fixed

- Resolved a logged error related to the pipe stack when using `PipeParallel`.
- The pipe tracker functionality has been restored. It no longer crashes when using nested object attributes (e.g., `my_object.attribute`) as pipe inputs.

### Tests

- A new pytest command-line option `--pipe-run-mode` has been added to switch between `live` and `dry` runs (default is `dry`). All pipe tests now respect this mode.
- Introduced the `pipelex_api` pytest marker for tests related to the Pipelex API client, separating them from general `inference` or `llm` tests.
- Added a `make test-pipelex-api` target (shorthand: `make ta`) to exclusively run these new API client tests.

### Removed

- The `llm_job_func.py` file and the associated decorators have been removed as part of the cognitive worker refactoring.

## [v0.2.14] - 2025-06-06

- Added a feature flag for the `ReportingManager` in the config: 
```bash
[pipelex]
[pipelex.feature_config]
is_reporting_enabled = true
```
- Moved the reporting config form the `cogt`config to the Pipelex config.

## [v0.2.13] - 2025-06-06

- Added Discord badge on the Readme. Join the community! -> https://go.pipelex.com/discord
- Added a client for the Pipelex API. Join the waitlist -> https://www.pipelex.com/signup
- Removed the `run_pipe_code` function. Replaced by `execute_pipeline` in `pipelex.pipeline.execute`.
- Added llm deck `llm_for_img_to_text`.
- Renamed `InferenceReportManager` to `ReportingManager`: It can report more than Inference cost. Renamed `InferenceReportDelegate` to `ReportingProtocol`.
- Added an injection of dependency for `ReportingManager`
- pipelex cli: fixed some bugs

## [v0.2.12] - 2025-06-03

- pipelex cli: Split `pipelex init` into 2 separate functions: `pipelex init-libraries` and `pipelex init-config`
- Fixed the inheritance config manager method
- Rename Mission to Pipeline
- Enable to start a pipeline and let in run in the background, getting it's run id, but not waiting for the output
- `Makefile`: avoid defaulting pytest to verbose. Setup target `make test-xdist` = Run unit tests with `xdist`, make it the default for shorthand `make t`. The old `make t` is now `make tp` (test-with-prints)
- Added `mistral-small-3.1` and `qwen3:8b`
- Fix template pre-processor: don't try and substitute a dollar numerical like $10 or @25
- Refactor with less "OpenAI" naming for non-openai stuff that just uses the OpenAI SDK

## [v0.2.11] - 2025-06-02

- HotFix for v0.2.10 👇 regarding the new pipelex/pipelex_init.toml`

## [v0.2.10] - 2025-06-02

### Highlights

**Python Support Expansion** - We're no longer tied to Python 3.11! Now supporting Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, and 3.13 with full CI coverage across all versions.

**Major Model Additions** - Claude 4 (Opus & Sonnet), Grok-3, and GPT-4 image generation are now in the house.

### Pipeline Base Library update
- **New pipe** - `ocr_page_contents_and_views_from_pdf` transferred from cookbook to base library (congrats on the promotion!). This pipe extracts text, linked images, **AND** page_view images (rendered pages) - it's very useful if you want to use Vision in follow-up pipes

### Added

- **Template preprocessor** - New `@?` token prefix for optional variable insertion - if a variable doesn't exist, we gracefully skip it instead of throwing exceptions
- **Claude 4 support** - Both Opus and Sonnet variants, available through Anthropic SDK (direct & Bedrock) plus Bedrock SDK. Includes specific max_tokens limit reduction to prevent timeout/streaming issues (temporary workaround)
- **Grok-3 family support** - Full support via OpenAI SDK for X.AI's latest models  
- **GPT-4 image generation** - New `gpt-image-1` model through OpenAI SDK, available via PipeImgGen. Currently saves local files (addressing in next release)
- **Gemini update** - Added latest `gemini-2.5-pro` to the lineup
- **Image generation enhancements** - Better quality controls, improved background handling options, auto-adapts to different models: Flux, SDXL and now gpt-image-1

### Refactored

- Moved subpackage `plugin` to the same level as `cogt` within **pipelex** for better visibility
- Major cleanup in the unit tests, hierarchy significantly flattened
- Strengthened error handling throughout inference flows and template preprocessing
- Added `make test-quiet` (shorthand `tq`) to Makefile to run tests without capturing outputs (i.e. without pytest `-s` option)
- Stopped using Fixtures for `pipe_router` and `content_generator`: we're now always getting the singleton from `pipelex.hub`


### Fixed

- **Perplexity integration** - Fixed breaking changes from recent updates

### Dependencies

- Added **pytest-xdist** to run unit tests in parallel on multiple CPUs. Not yet integrated into the Makefile, so run it manually with `pytest -n auto` (without inference) or `pytest -n auto -m "inference"` (inference only). 
- Swapped pytest-pretty for pytest-sugar - because readable test names > pretty tables
- Updated instructor to v1.8.3
- All dependencies tested against Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, and 3.13

### Tests

- TestTemplatePreprocessor
- TestImgGenByOpenAIGpt
- TestImageGeneration
- TestPipeImgGen


## [v0.2.9] - 2025-05-30

- pipelex cli: Added `list-pipes` method that can list all the available pipes along with their descriptions.
- Use a minimum version for `uv` instead of a fixed version
- Implement `AGENTS.md` for Codex
- Add tests for some of the `tools.misc`
- pipelex cli: Rename `pipelex run-setup` to `pipelex validate all -c pipelex/libraries`

## [v0.2.8] - 2025-05-28
