# PipeSequence Guide

## Purpose
PipeSequence executes multiple pipes in a defined order, where each step can use results from previous steps.

## Basic Structure
```plx
[pipe.your_sequence_name]
type = "PipeSequence"
description = "Description of what this sequence does"
inputs = { input_name = "InputType" } # All the inputs of the sub pipes, except the ones generated by intermediate steps
output = "OutputType"
steps = [
    { pipe = "first_pipe", result = "first_result" },
    { pipe = "second_pipe", result = "second_result" },
    { pipe = "final_pipe", result = "final_result" }
]
```

## Key Components

1. **Steps Array**: List of pipes to execute in sequence
   - `pipe`: Name of the pipe to execute
   - `result`: Name to assign to the pipe's output that will be in the working memory

2. **Working Memory**: Each step can access:
   - Original sequence inputs
   - Results from previous steps
   - Use the result names in subsequent steps
   - The output concept of the last step should be the output of the sequence

## Using PipeBatch in Steps

You can use PipeBatch functionality within steps using `batch_over` and `batch_as`:

```plx
steps = [
    { pipe = "process_items", batch_over = "input_list", batch_as = "current_item", result = "processed_items"
    }
]
```

1. **batch_over**: Specifies a `ListContent` field to iterate over. Each item in the list will be processed individually and IN PARALLEL by the pipe.
   - Must be a `ListContent` type containing the items to process
   - Can reference inputs or results from previous steps

2. **batch_as**: Defines the name that will be used to reference the current item being processed
   - This name can be used in the pipe's input mappings
   - Makes each item from the batch available as a single element

The result of a batched step will be a `ListContent` containing the outputs from processing each item.

# Important tip

Always run the cli `pipelex validate all -c pipelex/libraries` when you are finished writing pipelines: This checks for errors. If there are errors, iterate.
