# PipeCondition Controller

The PipeCondition controller allows you to implement conditional logic in your pipeline, choosing which pipe to execute based on an evaluated expression. It supports both direct expressions and expression templates.

## Usage in TOML Configuration

### Basic Usage with Direct Expression

```toml
[pipe.conditional_operation]
type = "PipeCondition"
description = "A conditonal pipe to decide wheter..."
inputs = { input_data = "CategoryInput" }
output = "native.Text"
expression = "input_data.category"

[pipe.conditional_operation.pipe_map]
small = "process_small"
medium = "process_medium"
large = "process_large"
```
or
```toml
[pipe.conditional_operation]
type = "PipeCondition"
description = "A conditonal pipe to decide wheter..."
inputs = { input_data = "CategoryInput" }
output = "native.Text"
expression_template = "{{ input_data.category }}" # Jinja2 code

[pipe.conditional_operation.pipe_map]
small = "process_small"
medium = "process_medium"
large = "process_large"
```

## Key Parameters

- `expression`: Direct boolean or string expression (mutually exclusive with expression_template)
- `expression_template`: Jinja2 template for more complex conditional logic (mutually exclusive with expression)
- `pipe_map`: Dictionary mapping expression results to pipe codes : 
1 - The key on the left (`small`, `medium`) is the result of `expression` or `expression_template`.
2 - The value on the right (`process_small`, `process_medium`, ..) is the name of the pipce to trigger

# Important tip

Always run the cli `pipelex validate all -c pipelex/libraries` when you are finished writing pipelines: This checks for errors. If there are errors, iterate.
