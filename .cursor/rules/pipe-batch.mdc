# PipeBatch Controller

The PipeBatch controller allows you to apply a pipe operation to each element in a list of inputs in parallele. It is created via a PipeSequence.

## Usage in PLX Configuration

```plx
[pipe.sequence_with_batch]
type = "Sequence"
description = "A Sequence of pipes"
inputs = { input_data = "ConceptName" }
output = "OutputConceptName"
steps = [
    { pipe = "pipe_to_apply", batch_over = "input_list", batch_as = "current_item", result = "batch_results" }
]
```

## Key Parameters

- `pipe`: The pipe operation to apply to each element in the batch
- `batch_over`: The name of the list in the context to iterate over
- `batch_as`: The name to use for the current element in the pipe's context
- `result`: Where to store the results of the batch operation

# Important tip

Always run the cli `pipelex validate all -c pipelex/libraries` when you are finished writing pipelines: This checks for errors. If there are errors, iterate.
