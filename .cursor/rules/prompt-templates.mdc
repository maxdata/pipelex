This rule explains how to write prompt templates in PipeLLM definitions.

## Insert stuff inside a tagged block

If the inserted text is supposedly long text, made of several lines or paragraphs, you want it inserted inside a block, possibly a block tagged and delimlited with proper syntax as one would do in a markdown documentation. To include stuff as a block, use the "@" prefix.

Example template:
```plx
prompt_template = """
Match the expense with its corresponding invoice:

@expense

@invoices
"""
```
In this example, the expense data and the invoices data are obviously made of several lines each, that's why it makes sense to use the "@" prefix in order to have them delimited inside a block. Note that our preprocessor will automatically include the block's title, so it doens't need to be explictly written in the prompt template.

**DO NOT write things like "Here is the expense: @expense".**
**DO write simply "@expense" alone in an isolated line.**

## Insert stuff inside a tagged block only if it exists (optional)

If you want to conditionally insert a block only when the variable exists and is not empty, use the "@?" prefix. This is useful for optional fields that may or may not be present in your data.

Example template:
```plx
prompt_template = """
User Profile:

@name

@?bio

@?contact_info

Please summarize this profile.
"""
```
In this example, the bio and contact_info will only be inserted if they exist. If they don't exist or are empty, those sections will be completely omitted from the rendered template.

**DO use "@?optional_field" when the field might not always be present.**
**DO NOT use "@optional_field" for fields that might be missing - this would cause an error.**

## Insert stuff inline

If the inserted text is short text and it makes sense to have it inserted directly into a sentence, you want it inserted inline. To insert stuff inline, use the "$" prefix. This will insert the stuff without delimiters and the content will be rendered as plain text.

Example template:
```plx
prompt_template = """
Your goal is to summarize everything related to $topic in the provided text:

@text

Please provide only the summary, with no additional text or explanations.
Your summary should not be longer than 2 sentences.
"""
```

Here, $topic will be inserted inline, whereas @text will be a a delimited block.
Be sure to make the proper choice of prefix for each insertion.

**DO NOT write "$topic" alone in an isolated line.**
**DO write things like "Write an essay about $topic" included in an actual sentence.**

## Style rule

If you need to add more complexe jinja2 template, we support the classic double curly brackets `{{ }}`
