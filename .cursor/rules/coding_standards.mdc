# Coding Standards & Best Practices

This document outlines the core coding standards, best practices, and quality control procedures for the codebase.

## Type Hints

1. **Always Use Type Hints**
   - Every function parameter must be typed
   - Every function return must be typed
   - Use type hints for all variables where type is not obvious
   - Use types with Uppercase first letter (Dict[], List[], etc.)

2. **StrEnum**
   - Import from `pipelex.types`:
   ```python
   from pipelex.types import StrEnum
   ```

## BaseModel Standards

- Respect Pydantic v2 standards
- Keep models focused and single-purpose
- Use descriptive field names
- Use type hints for all fields
- Document complex validations
- Use Optional[] for nullable fields
- Use Field(default_factory=...) for mutable defaults

## Factory Pattern

- Use Factory Pattern for object creation when dealing with multiple implementations

## Documentation

1. **Docstring Format**
   ```python
   def process_image(image_path: str, size: Tuple[int, int]) -> bytes:
       """Process and resize an image.
       
       Args:
           image_path: Path to the source image
           size: Tuple of (width, height) for resizing
           
       Returns:
           Processed image as bytes
       """
       pass
   ```

2. **Class Documentation**
   ```python
   class ImageProcessor:
       """Handles image processing operations.
       
       Provides methods for resizing, converting, and optimizing images.
       """
   ```

## Error Handling

1. **Graceful Error Handling**
   - Use try/except blocks with specific exceptions
   - Convert third-party exceptions to custom ones
   ```python
   try:
       from fal_client import AsyncClient as FalAsyncClient
   except ImportError as exc:
       raise MissingDependencyError(
           "fal-client", "fal", 
           "The fal-client SDK is required to use FAL models."
       ) from exc
   ```

## Code Quality Checks

### Linting and Type Checking

Before finalizing a task, run:
```bash
make fix-unused-imports
make check
```

This runs multiple code quality tools:
- Pyright: Static type checking
- Ruff: Fast Python linter  
- Mypy: Static type checker

Always fix any issues reported by these tools before proceeding.

### Running Tests

1. **Quick Test Run** (no LLM/image generation):
   ```bash
   make tp
   ```
   Runs tests with markers: `(dry_runnable or not (inference or llm or imgg or ocr)) and not (needs_output or pipelex_api)`

2. **Specific Tests**:
   ```bash
   make tp TEST=TestClassName
   # or
   make tp TEST=test_function_name
   ```
   Note: Matches names starting with the provided string.

**Important**: Never run `make ti`, `make test-inference`, `make to`, `make test-ocr`, `make tg`, or `make test-imgg` - these use costly inference.

## Pipelines

- All pipeline definitions go in `pipelex/libraries/pipelines/`
- Always validate pipelines after creation/edit with `make validate`.
  Iterate if there are errors.

## Project Structure

- **Pipelines**: `pipelex/libraries/pipelines/`
- **Tests**: `tests/` directory
- **Documentation**: `docs/` directory
