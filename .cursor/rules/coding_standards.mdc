# Coding Standards & Best Practices

This document outlines the core coding standards, best practices, and quality control procedures for the codebase.

## Type Hints

1. **Always Use Type Hints**

    - Every function parameter must be typed
    - Every function return must be typed
    - Use type hints for all variables where type is not obvious
    - Use dict, list, tupele types with lowercase first letter: dict[], list[], tuple[]
    - Use type hints for all fields
    - Use the `|` syntax for union types (e.g `str | int`) and `| None` for optionals
    - Use Field(default_factory=...) for mutable defaults and if it's a list of something else than str, use `empty_list_factory_of()` to make a factory: `number_list: list[int] = Field(default_factory=empty_list_factory_of(int), description="A list of numbers")`
    - Use `BaseModel` and respect Pydantic v2 standards, in particular use the modern `ConfigDict` when needed, e.g. `model_config = ConfigDict(extra="forbid", strict=True)`
    - Keep models focused and single-purpose

2. **StrEnum**
   - Import from `pipelex.types`:
   ```python
   from pipelex.types import StrEnum
   ```

3. **Self type**
   - Import from `pipelex.types`:
   ```python
   from pipelex.types import Self
   ```

## Factory Pattern

    - Use Factory Pattern for object creation when dealing with multiple implementations
    - Our factory methods are named `make_from_...` and such

## Error Handling

    - Always catch exceptions at the place where you can add useful context to it.
    - Use try/except blocks with specific exceptions
    - Convert third-party exceptions to our custom ones
    - Never catch Exception, only catch specific exceptions
    - Always add `from exc` to the exception
   
   ```python
   try:
       self.models_manager.setup()
   except RoutingProfileLibraryNotFoundError as exc:
       msg = "The routing library could not be found, please call `pipelex init config` to create it"
       raise PipelexSetupError(msg) from exc
   ```

   **Note**: Following Ruff rules, we set the error message as a variable before raising it, for cleaner error traces.

## Documentation

1. **Docstring Format**
   ```python
   def process_image(image_path: str, size: Tuple[int, int]) -> bytes:
       """Process and resize an image.
       
       Args:
           image_path: Path to the source image
           size: Tuple of (width, height) for resizing
           
       Returns:
           Processed image as bytes
       """
       pass
   ```

2. **Class Documentation**
   ```python
   class ImageProcessor:
       """Handles image processing operations.
       
       Provides methods for resizing, converting, and optimizing images.
       """
   ```

## Code Quality Checks

### Linting and Type Checking

Before finalizing a task, run:
```bash
make fix-unused-imports
make check
```

This runs multiple code quality tools:
- Pyright: Static type checking
- Ruff: Fast Python linter  
- Mypy: Static type checker

Always fix any issues reported by these tools before proceeding.

### Running Tests

1. **Quick Test Run** (no LLM/image generation):
   ```bash
   make tp
   ```
   Runs tests with markers: `(dry_runnable or not (inference or llm or img_gen or ocr)) and not (needs_output or pipelex_api)`

2. **Specific Tests**:
   ```bash
   make tp TEST=TestClassName
   # or
   make tp TEST=test_function_name
   ```
   Note: Matches names starting with the provided string.

**Important**: Never run `make ti`, `make test-inference`, `make to`, `make test-ocr`, `make tg`, or `make test-img-gen` - these use costly inference.

## Pipelines

- All pipeline definitions go in `pipelex/libraries/pipelines/`
- Always validate pipelines after creation/edit with `make validate`.
  Iterate if there are errors.

## Project Structure

- **Pipelines**: `pipelex/libraries/pipelines/`
- **Tests**: `tests/` directory
- **Documentation**: `docs/` directory
