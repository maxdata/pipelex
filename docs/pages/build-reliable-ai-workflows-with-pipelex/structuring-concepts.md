# Structuring Concepts

Pipelex offers two ways to add structure to your concepts: **inline TOML structures** and **Python classes**. This guide helps you choose the right approach and shows you how to use both effectively.

For an introduction to concepts themselves, see [Define Your Concepts](define_your_concepts.md).

## Quick Comparison

| Approach | Best For | Advantages | Limitations |
|----------|----------|------------|-------------|
| **Inline TOML** | Most use cases, prototyping | Fast, single-file, no boilerplate | No custom validation or methods |
| **Python Class** | Complex validation, computed properties | Full Pydantic power, IDE support | More files, more code |

## Inline Structure Definition

Define structured concepts directly in your `.plx` files using TOML syntax. This is the **recommended approach** for most use cases.

### Quick Example

```plx
domain = "finance"

[concept.Invoice]
description = "A commercial document issued by a seller to a buyer"

[concept.Invoice.structure]
invoice_number = "The unique invoice identifier"
issue_date = { type = "date", description = "The date the invoice was issued", required = true }
total_amount = { type = "number", description = "The total invoice amount", required = true }
vendor_name = "The name of the vendor"
line_items = { type = "list", item_type = "text", description = "List of items in the invoice", required = false }
```

Behind the scenes, Pipelex automatically generates a fully-typed Pydantic model with validation—all from TOML.

### Supported Field Types

Inline structures support these field types:

- **text**: String values
- **integer**: Whole numbers
- **boolean**: True/false values
- **number**: Numeric values (integers or floats)
- **date**: Date and datetime values
- **list**: Arrays/lists (specify `item_type`)
- **dict**: Dictionaries (specify `key_type` and `value_type`)

### Field Properties

Each field can specify:

- **type**: The data type (required for detailed definitions)
- **description**: Human-readable description
- **required**: Whether the field is mandatory (default: `true`)
- **default_value**: Default value if not provided
- **choices**: For enum-like fields, a list of valid values
- **item_type**: For list fields, the type of list items
- **key_type** and **value_type**: For dict fields, the types of keys and values

### Simple vs Detailed Syntax

**Simple syntax** (creates required text field):

```plx
[concept.Person.structure]
name = "The person's full name"
email = "The person's email address"
```

**Detailed syntax** (explicit properties):

```plx
[concept.Employee.structure]
employee_id = { type = "integer", description = "Unique employee identifier", required = true }
department = { type = "text", description = "Department name", required = false, default_value = "General" }
is_active = { type = "boolean", description = "Employment status", required = false, default_value = true }
```

You can mix both styles in the same structure.

### Complex Field Examples

**List Fields:**

```plx
[concept.Project.structure]
name = "Project name"
tags = { type = "list", item_type = "text", description = "Project tags", required = false }
team_members = { type = "list", item_type = "text", description = "Team member names", required = true }
```

**Dictionary Fields:**

```plx
[concept.Configuration.structure]
app_name = "Application name"
settings = { type = "dict", key_type = "text", value_type = "text", description = "Configuration settings", required = false }
```

**Choice Fields (Enums):**

```plx
[concept.Task.structure]
title = "Task title"
priority = { choices = ["low", "medium", "high"], description = "Task priority level", required = true }
status = { choices = ["todo", "in_progress", "done"], description = "Current status", default_value = "todo" }
```

## Python StructuredContent Classes

For advanced features, create explicit Python classes that inherit from `StructuredContent`.

### When to Use Python Classes

Use Python classes when you need:

1. **Custom validation logic** - Cross-field validation, complex rules
2. **Computed properties** - Derived values, formatted outputs
3. **Custom methods** - Business logic, helper functions
4. **Reusability** - Shared structures across multiple domains
5. **Advanced typing** - `Literal`, complex unions, etc.
6. **Better IDE support** - Full autocomplete and type checking

### Basic Python Class Example

```python
from pipelex.core.stuffs.structured_content import StructuredContent
from pydantic import Field

class Invoice(StructuredContent):
    """A commercial invoice."""
    
    invoice_number: str = Field(description="Unique invoice identifier")
    issue_date: datetime = Field(description="Date the invoice was issued")
    total_amount: float = Field(ge=0, description="Total invoice amount")
    vendor_name: str = Field(description="Name of the vendor")
    line_items: list[str] = Field(default_factory=list, description="List of items")
```

Classes inheriting from `StructuredContent` are automatically discovered and registered by Pipelex.

!!! warning "Module Execution During Auto-Discovery"
    When Pipelex discovers `StructuredContent` classes, it imports the module containing them. **Any code at the module level (outside functions/classes) will be executed during import.** This can have unintended side effects.
    
    **Best practice:** Keep your `StructuredContent` classes in dedicated modules (e.g., `*_struct.py` files) with minimal module-level code, or ensure module-level code is safe to execute during discovery.

### With Custom Validation

```python
from pipelex.core.stuffs.structured_content import StructuredContent
from pydantic import Field, field_validator

class Invoice(StructuredContent):
    """A commercial invoice with validation."""
    
    total_amount: float = Field(ge=0, description="Total invoice amount")
    tax_amount: float = Field(ge=0, description="Tax amount")
    net_amount: float = Field(ge=0, description="Net amount before tax")
    
    @field_validator('tax_amount')
    @classmethod
    def validate_tax(cls, v, info):
        """Ensure tax doesn't exceed total."""
        total = info.data.get('total_amount', 0)
        if v > total:
            raise ValueError('Tax amount cannot exceed total amount')
        return v
```

### With Computed Properties

```python
from datetime import datetime
from pipelex.core.stuffs.structured_content import StructuredContent
from pydantic import Field

class Subscription(StructuredContent):
    """A subscription with computed properties."""
    
    start_date: datetime = Field(description="Subscription start date")
    end_date: datetime = Field(description="Subscription end date")
    monthly_price: float = Field(ge=0, description="Monthly subscription price")
    
    @property
    def duration_days(self) -> int:
        """Calculate subscription duration in days."""
        return (self.end_date - self.start_date).days
    
    @property
    def total_cost(self) -> float:
        """Calculate total subscription cost."""
        months = self.duration_days / 30.0
        return months * self.monthly_price
```

## Advantages of Inline Structures

Inline structures offer several benefits:

### Rapid Development

- **Single File**: Keep concepts, structures, and pipes all in one `.plx` file
- **No Context Switching**: No need to jump between `.plx` and `.py` files
- **Quick Iteration**: Modify structures instantly without managing separate files

### Simplicity

- **Declarative Syntax**: Straightforward TOML that's easy to read and write
- **No Boilerplate**: No need for Python imports, class definitions, or field declarations
- **Automatic Registration**: Generated classes are automatically discovered

### Type Safety

- **Pydantic Models**: Full Pydantic v2 models behind the scenes
- **Runtime Validation**: Automatic validation of structured outputs from LLMs
- **Type Hints**: Generated classes include proper type annotations

## Limitations of Inline Structures

### What Inline Structures Cannot Do

Inline structures cannot provide:

- **Custom validators** - No `@field_validator` decorators
- **Computed properties** - No `@property` methods
- **Custom methods** - No class methods or instance methods
- **Complex validation** - No cross-field validation logic
- **Nested custom concepts** - Cannot reference other custom concepts as field types (coming soon)
- **Advanced Pydantic features** - No custom serializers, model validators, etc.

### Concept Refinement Restrictions

Currently, inline structures can only be used for concepts that:

- Don't refine other concepts, OR
- Refine native concepts only: `Text`, `Image`, `PDF`, `TextAndImages`, `Number`, `Page`

### Tooling Limitations

- **Limited IDE autocomplete** compared to explicit Python classes
- **No static type checking** with `mypy` or `pyright`
- **Less refactoring support** in IDEs

## Using AI to Create Python Classes

Modern AI coding assistants like Cursor AI and GitHub Copilot can generate `StructuredContent` classes instantly, making the transition from inline structures to Python classes fast and easy.

### Recommended Workflow

Follow this pragmatic approach:

1. **Prototype Fast**: Start with inline structures for rapid development
2. **Validate Quickly**: Test your pipelines and iterate on the structure
3. **Upgrade When Needed**: Convert to Python classes when you need advanced features
4. **Let AI Help**: Use AI assistants to generate the Python code automatically

### Example: AI-Assisted Migration

**Step 1: Start with inline structure**

```plx
[concept.UserProfile]
description = "A user profile"

[concept.UserProfile.structure]
username = "The user's username"
email = "The user's email address"
age = { type = "integer", description = "User's age", required = false }
```

**Step 2: Ask your AI assistant**

> "Convert this inline UserProfile structure to a Python StructuredContent class with email validation"

**Step 3: AI generates the class**

```python
from pipelex.core.stuffs.structured_content import StructuredContent
from pydantic import Field, field_validator
import re

class UserProfile(StructuredContent):
    """A user profile with validation."""
    
    username: str = Field(description="The user's username")
    email: str = Field(description="The user's email address")
    age: int | None = Field(default=None, description="User's age")
    
    @field_validator('email')
    @classmethod
    def validate_email(cls, v):
        """Validate email format."""
        pattern = r'^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$'
        if not re.match(pattern, v):
            raise ValueError('Invalid email format')
        return v
```

**Step 4: Update your .plx file**

```plx
[concept]
UserProfile = "A user profile"  # Structure now defined in Python
```

The Python class is automatically discovered and registered.

## Migration Guide

### From Inline Structure to Python Class

Here's how to migrate when you need more advanced features:

**1. You have this inline structure:**

```plx
domain = "ecommerce"

[concept.Product]
description = "A product in the catalog"

[concept.Product.structure]
product_id = { type = "integer", description = "Unique product ID", required = true }
name = "Product name"
price = { type = "number", description = "Product price", required = true }
in_stock = { type = "boolean", description = "Stock availability", default_value = true }
```

**2. Create a Python file** (e.g., `ecommerce_struct.py`):

```python
from pipelex.core.stuffs.structured_content import StructuredContent
from pydantic import Field

class Product(StructuredContent):
    """A product in the catalog."""
    
    product_id: int = Field(description="Unique product ID")
    name: str = Field(description="Product name")
    price: float = Field(ge=0, description="Product price")
    in_stock: bool = Field(default=True, description="Stock availability")
```

**3. Update your `.plx` file:**

```plx
domain = "ecommerce"

[concept]
Product = "A product in the catalog"

# Structure section removed - now defined in ecommerce_struct.py
```

**4. Test your pipeline** - The behavior should be identical.

**5. Add enhancements** (optional):

```python
class Product(StructuredContent):
    """A product in the catalog."""
    
    product_id: int = Field(description="Unique product ID")
    name: str = Field(description="Product name")
    price: float = Field(ge=0, description="Product price")
    in_stock: bool = Field(default=True, description="Stock availability")
    
    @field_validator('price')
    @classmethod
    def validate_price(cls, v):
        """Ensure price is positive and reasonable."""
        if v < 0:
            raise ValueError('Price cannot be negative')
        if v > 1_000_000:
            raise ValueError('Price seems unreasonably high')
        return v
    
    @property
    def display_price(self) -> str:
        """Format price for display."""
        return f"${self.price:.2f}"
```

## Recommendations

The inline structure feature is a **practical solution for the majority of use cases**. Use it to:

- Get started quickly without Python overhead
- Keep all pipeline logic in one place
- Iterate rapidly during development
- Still get full type safety and validation

When your needs grow, **Python `StructuredContent` classes offer more power and flexibility**.

### Guidelines

- ✅ **Use inline structures** for straightforward data models
- ✅ **Use inline structures** during prototyping and early development
- ✅ **Use inline structures** for domain-specific models with simple validation
- ✅ **Use Python classes** when you need custom validation logic
- ✅ **Use Python classes** for reusable, shared data models
- ✅ **Use Python classes** when you need computed properties or methods
- ✅ **Use Python classes** for complex type relationships

Remember: You can always start with inline structures and migrate to Python classes later. The migration is straightforward, and AI assistants can help you make the transition quickly.

## Future Roadmap

### Nested Custom Concepts (Coming Soon)

Soon, you'll be able to reference other custom concepts as field types in inline structures:

```plx
[concept.Address.structure]
street = "Street address"
city = "City name"
postal_code = "Postal or ZIP code"

[concept.Company.structure]
name = "Company name"
headquarters = { type = "Address", description = "Company headquarters", required = true }
```

This will enable building complex, nested data models entirely within `.plx` files.
