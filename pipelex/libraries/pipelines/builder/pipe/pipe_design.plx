Here are the Jinja2 filters that are supported:
abs — Returns the absolute value of a number.
attr — Gets an attribute from an object, returning undefined if missing.
batch — Groups items into sublists of a given size, optionally filling blanks.
capitalize — Uppercases the first character and lowercases the rest.
center — Centers a string within a given width.
default — Returns a fallback value if the input is undefined (or falsey if enabled).
dictsort — Sorts a dict and yields (key, value) pairs by key or value.
escape — HTML-escapes &, <, >, ' and ".
filesizeformat — Formats bytes as human-readable sizes (kB/MB or KiB/MiB).
first — Returns the first item of a sequence.
float — Converts a value to float with an optional default.
forceescape — Forces HTML escaping even if marked safe.
format — Applies printf-style string formatting.
groupby — Groups items by an attribute (sorted first).
indent — Indents each line of a string by a given width.
int — Converts a value to int with base and default support.
items — Iterates over a mapping’s items, empty if undefined.
join — Concatenates sequence items with an optional separator or attribute.
last — Returns the last item of a sequence.
length — Returns the number of items (alias: count).
list — Converts the value to a list (strings become lists of characters).
lower — Converts a string to lowercase.
map — Extracts an attribute or applies a filter across a sequence.
max — Returns the largest item, optionally by attribute.
min — Returns the smallest item, optionally by attribute.
pprint — Pretty-prints a value for debugging.
random — Returns a random item from a sequence.
reject — Filters out items where a test passes.
rejectattr — Filters out items based on an attribute test.
replace — Replaces occurrences of a substring with another.
reverse — Reverses a string or iterable.
round — Rounds a number with precision and method (common/ceil/floor).
safe — Marks a string as safe and prevents auto-escaping.
select — Keeps only items where a test passes.
selectattr — Keeps only items whose attribute passes a test.
slice — Slices items into N columns (lists of lists), with optional fill.
sort — Sorts an iterable, with reverse, case, and attribute options.
string — Converts to string while preserving Markup safety.
striptags — Removes HTML/XML tags and collapses whitespace.
sum — Sums numbers or an attribute across items, with a start value.
title — Title-cases the string (each word capitalized).
tojson — Serializes a value to JSON and marks it safe for HTML.
trim — Strips leading and trailing characters (default: whitespace).
truncate — Shortens text to a length with optional word-safe ellipsis.
unique — Yields unique items in first-seen order, optional attribute.
upper — Converts a string to uppercase.
urlencode — URL-encodes a string or builds a query string from pairs.
urlize — Converts URLs/emails in text into clickable links.
wordcount — Counts words in a string.
wordwrap — Wraps text to a given width with options for breaks.
xmlattr — Builds safe HTML/XML attributes from a dict.
