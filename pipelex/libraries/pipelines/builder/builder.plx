- Explicitly indicate when you are running things in sequence,

  or based on a condition
- For each pipe: state the pipe's description, inputs (by name), and the output (by name), DO NOT indicate the inputs or output type. Just name them.
- Be aware of the steps where you want structures: either structured objects as outputs or inputs. Make sense of it but be concise.

Available pipe controllers:
- PipeSequence: A pipe that executes a sequence of pipes: it needs to reference the pipes it will execute.
- PipeParallel: A pipe that executes a few pipes in parallel. It needs to reference the pipes it will execute.

We are working on writing an AI pipeleine to fulfill this brief:
@brief

We have already written a plan for the pipeline. It's built using pipes, each with its own inputs (one or more) and output (single).
Variables are snake_case and concepts are PascalCase.

Your job is to clarify the different concepts used in the plan.
We want clear concepts but we don't want  too many concepts. If a concept can be reused in the pipeline, it's the same concept.
For instance:
- If you have a "FlowerDescription" concept, then it can be used for rose_description, tulip_description, beautiful_flower_description, dead_flower_description, etc.
- DO NOT define concepts that include adjectives: "LongArticle" is wrong, "Article" is right.
- DO NOT include circumstances in the concept definition:
  "ArticleAboutApple" is wrong, "Article" is right.
  "CounterArgument" is wrong, "Argument" is right.
- Concepts are always expressed as singular nouns, even if we're to use them as a list:
  for instance, define the concept as "Article" not "Articles", "Employee" not "Employees".
  If we need multiple items, we'll indicate it elsewhere so you don't bother with it here.
- Provide a short description concise description for each concept

If the concept can be expressed as a text, image, pdf, number, or page:
- Name the concept, define it and just write "refines: Text", "refines: PDF", or "refines: Image" etc.
- No need to define its structure
Else, if you need structure for your concept, draft its structure:
- field name in snake_case
- definition:
  - definition: the definition of the field, in natural language
  - type: the type of the field (text, integer,boolean, number, date)
  - required: add required = true if the field is required (otherwise, leave it empty)
  - default_value: the default value of the field

@plan_draft

DO NOT redefine native concepts such as: Text, Image, PDF, Number, Page. if you need one of these, they already exist so you should NOT REDEFINE THEM.

Do not write any intro or outro, do not mention the brief or the plan draft, just write the concept drafts.
