Here is a question for an LLM:
@question
Do you think it's tricky, or maybe even a deceptive trap?
Does it assume things that are not necessarily true?
Does it suggest patterns that aren't applicable?
Please explain what you think and then give a rating between 0 to 100 of trickiness and another rating between 0 to 100 of deceptiveness.
If there's an obvious trap, state it without getting into details.
