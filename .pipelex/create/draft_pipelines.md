# Drafting Pipelex Pipelines

This guide explains how to draft pipelines in natural language using markdown notation before translating them into formal Pipelex definitions.

## Core Concept: WorkingMemory

Every pipeline execution maintains a `WorkingMemory` that acts as a shared data space. When a pipeline starts, the initial inputs are placed in this memory. As each pipe executes, its output is added to the memory with a specific name (the `result` name). Subsequent pipes can access any data in the memory by referencing these names.

**Key Rules**: 

- When a pipe produces an output with name `X`, any later pipe can use `X` as an input. The names must match exactly.
- Controller pipes (PipeSequence, PipeParallel, PipeCondition) automatically inherit the input requirements of their nested operators - you don't need to specify their inputs explicitly.

## Drafting Workflow

1. **Start with the goal**: What does this pipeline accomplish?
2. **Define inputs**: What data does it need to start?
3. **Narrate the flow**: Describe each step and how data flows through WorkingMemory
4. **Specify outputs**: What final result emerges?

## Pipeline Draft Structure

### Header
```markdown
# Pipeline: [pipeline_name]
Domain: [domain_name]
Purpose: [What this pipeline does]
```

### Inputs Section
```markdown
## Inputs
- `document` : PDF document to analyze
- `criteria` : Analysis criteria to apply
```

### Flow Section

Describe the pipeline flow using concise step notation:

```markdown
## Flow

WorkingMemory starts with: {document, criteria}

### Step 1: Process document content
LLM[process]: (document) → processed_content

WorkingMemory now contains: {document, criteria, processed_content}

### Step 2: Apply analysis criteria to processed content
LLM[synthesize]: (processed_content, criteria) → analysis_report

WorkingMemory now contains: {document, criteria, processed_content, analysis_report}
```

### Output Section
```markdown
## Output
Returns: `analysis_report` - Comprehensive analysis based on criteria
```

## Pipe Types and Notation

## Operator Notations

**Important**: During drafting, DO NOT write actual prompts or prompt templates. Focus on describing what each operator does and how data flows. Prompts will be written during implementation.

### LLM Operations (including vision, to generate text from text and images)
```markdown
LLM[purpose]: (inputs) → output

Examples:
LLM[summarize]: (long_text) → summary
LLM[analyze]: (document, criteria) → analysis
```

### OCR Operations (to extract text and images from PDF pages, including full page views)
```markdown
OCR: (pdf_document) → pages_list
```

### Image Generation (to generate images from text prompts)
```markdown
ImgGen: (prompt_text) → generated_image
```

### Function Operations (to call external python functions)
```markdown
Func[function_name]: (data) → result
```

### Sequential Processing (to run steps in sequence, use it when steps need results from previous steps)
```markdown
Step 1: Extract key information from document
extract_info(document) → key_info

Step 2: Analyze extracted information
analyze(key_info) → analysis

Step 3: Generate report with original document context
generate_report(analysis, document) → report
```

### Batch Processing (to process each item in a list independently and in parallel)
```markdown
Process each item in documents:
analyze_document(document) → analysis

Collect all results → document_analyses
```

### Parallel Processing (to run different pipes in parallel from the same memory, use it when steps can be run independently, each with a copy of the working memory)
```markdown
Parallel execution:

Branch A: Extract technical details
extract_technical(document) → technical_info

Branch B: Extract business insights
extract_business(document) → business_info

Combine: Merge analysis results
merge_insights(technical_info, business_info) → comprehensive_analysis
```

### Conditional Processing (to run different pipes based on a condition)
```markdown
Route based on expression(document_type):

Case "technical": Handle technical documents
analyze_technical(document) → analysis

Case "legal": Handle legal documents
analyze_legal(document) → analysis

Default: Handle general documents
analyze_general(document) → analysis
```

## Memory Flow Examples

### Example 1: Document Analysis Pipeline
```markdown
# Pipeline: analyze_document
Domain: document_analysis
Purpose: Extract and analyze key information from documents

## Inputs
- `document` : PDF document to analyze

## Flow

WorkingMemory: {document}

### Step 1: Extract content from PDF
OCR: (document) → pages

WorkingMemory: {document, pages}

### Step 2: Summarize each page in parallel
Process each page in pages:
LLM[summarize]: (page) → summary

Collect all results → summaries

WorkingMemory: {document, pages, summaries}

### Step 3: Create comprehensive analysis from summaries
LLM[synthesize]: (summaries) → analysis

WorkingMemory: {document, pages, summaries, analysis}

## Output
Returns: `analysis`
```

### Example 2: Conditional Processing
```markdown
# Pipeline: smart_responder
Domain: customer_service
Purpose: Route and respond to customer queries

## Inputs
- `query` : Customer question
- `context` : Available context information

## Flow

WorkingMemory: {query, context}

### Step 1: Classify query into support category
LLM[classify]: (query) → category

WorkingMemory: {query, context, category}

### Step 2: Route to appropriate support handler
Route based on category:

Case "technical": Technical support handler
LLM[technical_support]: (query, context) → response

Case "billing": Billing support handler
LLM[billing_support]: (query, context) → response

Default: General support handler
LLM[general_support]: (query) → response

WorkingMemory: {query, context, category, response}

## Output
Returns: `response`
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use semantic variable names**: Name variables based on what they represent, not how they're used. Use `document` instead of `input_document`, `text` instead of `input_text`, `analysis` instead of `result_1`.

2. **Name consistently**: Once you name a result (e.g., `analysis`), use that exact name when referencing it later.

3. **Show memory state**: After complex steps, show what's in WorkingMemory to track data flow.

4. **Be explicit about inputs**: For each operator step, clearly indicate which items from WorkingMemory are being used.

5. **Use descriptive names**: Choose names that clearly describe the content: `summaries`, `technical_info`, `user_preferences`.

6. **Concise step descriptions**: Each step should have a clear title that describes what it accomplishes. Avoid repeating the same information in multiple places.

7. **No prompts during drafting**: Focus on describing WHAT each step does, not HOW (the actual prompts). Prompts are implementation details added later.

8. **Block vs Inline references**:
   - Use `@variable_name` notation for block insertions (multi-line content)
   - Use `$variable_name` notation for inline insertions (single values in sentences)

9. **Batch operations**: When processing lists, clearly indicate:
   - What list is being iterated (`batch_over`)
   - What each item is called during processing (`batch_as`)
   - What the collected results are named

## Validation Checklist

Before finalizing your draft:

- [ ] Every input used by an operator pipe exists in WorkingMemory (either from initial inputs or previous steps)
- [ ] Every result name is unique (no overwriting unless intentional)
- [ ] The final output exists in WorkingMemory
- [ ] Names are consistent throughout (no typos or variations)
- [ ] Variable names are semantic (describe what they are, not how they're used)
- [ ] The flow clearly shows data transformation from inputs to outputs
- [ ] Each step has a concise, non-repetitive description

## From Draft to Implementation

Once your markdown draft is complete, it can be translated into:
1. A formal PLX pipeline definition with explicit pipe declarations
2. Python structure classes for complex data types (when needed)
3. Validated, executable Pipelex pipeline code

The narrative draft serves as both documentation and a blueprint for implementation, making the pipeline's logic transparent and maintainable.
